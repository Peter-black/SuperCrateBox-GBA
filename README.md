# Super Crate Box GBA

http://pete.black/projects/supercratebox/

A simplified clone of the arcade game Super Crate Box made by Vlambeer. The game is about collecting as many crates as possible and avoiding enemies!

This is one of my favourite games , as it is a retro style game I decided to make a clone in a retro way, GBA style! 

The Original game concept and assets are from Super Crate Box (supercratebox.com) by Vlambeer (vlambeer.com)

A GameBoy Advance emulator is required to run this game

I recommend Visual Boy Advance which can be found at http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/gba/vboyadvance.HTML

The default controls on the emulator map the DPAD to the Arrow Keys, A Button to Z and B Button to X.
